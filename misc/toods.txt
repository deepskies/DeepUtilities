TODO LIST

Pipeline overview
1. IO
2. Preproc
3. Train
4. Plot

There is a lot to do!!

Crucial adds:
* tensorflow nn support
  - need to make a call if we want to only support tf2
* largely improve the interface with the cloud and running jobs on cloud (gcloud rn)
  - docker, kubernetes, kubeflow, gcloud storage, etc
* documentation

Less crucial:
* styling
*



lists of resources and relevant packages/tools:
1. onnx - open nn exchange (this will be great for sharing w the broader academic community) - built in pytorch support
2. tensorflow extended (tfx)
3.
