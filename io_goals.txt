ML engineers at deep skies are given a variety of data formats and efficiently loading the data for training is a bottleneck.

The goal of the io part of dsutils is meant to allow people at deepskies to use a standardized method for loading data into models for training.

Fits files are common at DS so we want to load it into the following format:

/X/<ID>_data
/Y/<ID>_label

We are planning on using a h5 format.


I'm going to be documenting the Plasticc Kaggle set into an H5 file.

I'm thinking that there will be groups X and Y.

Where X will contain all of the light curve data and Y will contain the target
